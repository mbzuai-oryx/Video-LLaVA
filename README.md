## 🏆 Contributions

The key contributions of this work are:

- We propose PG-Video-LLaVA, **the first video-based LMM with pixel-level grounding capabilities**, featuring a modular design for enhanced flexibility. Our framework uses an off-the-shelf tracker and a novel grounding module, enabling it to spatially ground objects in videos following user instructions.

- We introduce a **new benchmark specifically designed to measure prompt-based object grounding performance**.

- By incorporating audio context, PG-Video-LLaVA significantly **enhances its understanding of video content**, making it more comprehensive and aptly suited for scenarios where the audio signal is crucial for video understanding (e.g., dialogues and conversations, news videos, etc.).

- We introduce **improved quantitative benchmarks** for video-based conversational models. Our benchmarks utilize open-source Vicuna LLM to ensure better reproducibility and transparency. We also propose benchmarks to evaluate the grounding capabilities of video-based conversational models.

### Video-ChatGPT vs PG-Video-LLaVA<img src="docs/images/logos/logo.png" height="20">

PG-Video-LLaVA is based on a stronger image-LMM baseline which gives it better conversational ability compared to its predecessor.

##  Quantitative Evaluation 📊

We evaluate PG-Video-LLaVA using video-based generative and question-answering benchmarks. We also introduce new benchmarks specifically designed to measure prompt-based object grounding performance in videos.

### Video Grounding 🎯

To quantitatively assess PG-Video-LLaVA’s spatial grounding capability, we conducted quantitative evaluations of PG-Video-LLaVA’s spatial grounding capabilities using two benchmarks that are derived from the test set of the VidSTG and HC-STVG datasets.

For detailed instructions on performing quantitative evaluation on video grounding, please refer [this](/grounding_evaluation/README.md).

### Video-based Generative Performance Benchmarking 🤖

We apply the benchmarking framework from Video-ChatGPT which measures performance on several axes critical for video-based conversational agents, including correctness of information, detail orientation, contextual understanding, temporal understanding, and consistency. In order to facilitate a reliable and reproducible evaluation, we have updated our assessment pipeline by replacing GPT-3.5 with Vicuna-13b-v1.5.

### Zero-Shot Question Answering 💬

Zero-shot question-answering (QA) capabilities were evaluated quantitatively using several established open-ended QA datasets: MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA, TGIF-QA, and ActivityNet-QA.
